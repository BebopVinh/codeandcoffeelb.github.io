Yo! I'm Aaron Turner! I tend to spend my time developing in the frontend since I like to see what I'm doing. I enjoy development with AngularJS, and I have quite a love for Android.

I love taking on random small projects that usually accomplish a single task, they usually end up buggy cause I tend to code stream of consciousness, but I also enjoy going back and fixing things up

I also do a lot of other really fun things! I make some [chill tunes](https://aviscerall.bandcamp.com/album/lps-and-love-songs). And, I do a lot of [rad skateboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OktGiy8GWg).
