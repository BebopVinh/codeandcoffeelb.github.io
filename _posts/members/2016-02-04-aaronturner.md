Yo! I'm Aaron Turner! I tend to spend my time developing in the frontend since I like to see what I'm doing. I enjoy development with AngularJS, and I have quite a love for Android.

I love taking on random small projects that usually accomplish a single task, they usually end up buggy cause I tend to code stream of consciousness, but I enjoy going back and fixing things up
