My journey through education has been very slow and steady. I have a strong interest in mathematics, programming, and business. I was recently employed at a math learning center as the Director and have helped my family develop a small organic produce delivery business. Currently I am helping small non-profits with some backend processes. Something interesting about myself I suppose I want to share is that I have loved onions since I was a small child though they may not be the most helpful aid in my professional presentation.

I have a beagleboard black that I picked up that I would like to explore.

My goals are to be always learning, helping, and sharing.
