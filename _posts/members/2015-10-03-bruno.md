Hi, I'm new to Long Beach and I really like it here!  Nice to meet y'all!

Over the last 15 years, I've been working in the data analytics field, crunching data, looking for insights.  I
also work a lot with web analytics platforms, like Google Analytics.

I've had a fascination with programming for a while, but somehow ended up doing other "things".
It started in high school, when I created a ferris wheel and carnival scene in BASIC.  There was also a juggler.

In college, there was a programming class requirement. The class was Turbo Pascal.  I have
an interesting story here, but that's for another day.

Since then I've played around with a bunch of "stuff", like Javascript, HTML, and Python.

This is a great group, I encourage anyone interested in programming to check it out.
