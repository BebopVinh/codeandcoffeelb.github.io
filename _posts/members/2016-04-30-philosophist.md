#Who am I
I am Steven R. Parker. I am self taught in front end web development and have lower division undergraduate education in Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Interested in Neuroscience and research in general. Programming is my fall back until I get my degree and then I intend to combine all of my skills into great projects that will skyrocket my career, whatever it may be, rather that leave me stuck in the "You have no experience" whirlpool that most biology students face today.



#What am I working on
Currently I'm working on projects provided by:
