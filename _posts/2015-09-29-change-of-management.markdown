description: Or where that James went, and who this Roger is...
---

For the last year or so, James Hall devoted his Saturdays to bringing together a diverse group of hackers from in and around Long Beach in a friendly, casual environment. Friends were made, fun was had, code was written, and bellies filled.

Alas, all things must change. First, *Code and Coffee, Long Beach* transitioned from under the LBTech umbrella, and found a new home as an initiative of the recently-formed [UncodedLB][uncodedlb], giving us additional support and room to grow. Then, in late 2015, James' time in Long Beach came to an end - at least for now. To keep this wonderful tradition alive, James handed off organizational responsibility to [Roger Howard][whoisroger].

Roger is a regular attendee of Code and Coffee, Long Beach, the CTO of Long Beach startup Critique-it, and a member of the Uncoded board, and has big plans for this event. Please stay tuned as we grow this initiative. In the meantime, read more [About Code and Coffee, LB][aboutcclb] if you're interested.
